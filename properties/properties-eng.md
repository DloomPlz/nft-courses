# Metadatas


The metadata of an NFT refers to the data associated with the token that provides information about its ownership and provenance. This can include the name of the creator, the date of creation, a description of the item, and any other relevant details. The metadata is typically stored on the blockchain, allowing for transparent and verifiable information about the NFT. This can help to establish the authenticity and value of the asset.

## IPFS


IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a decentralized file storage system that can be used to store the metadata of an NFT. Instead of storing the data on a central server, IPFS distributes the data across a network of nodes, which helps to make the system more secure and resilient. This can be useful for NFTs, as it allows for the secure and verifiable storage of metadata, helping to establish the provenance and authenticity of the asset. IPFS is just one of the many technologies that can be used to store NFT metadata, and other options include distributed databases and traditional centralized servers.
